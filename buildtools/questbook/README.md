# GTE2 Translation - Questbook
## How to translate

1. First, you need to download the [latest version](https://github.com/GTModpackTeam/GTE2-Translations/releases)
2. Download the `DefaultQuests_lang.json`
3. Open the GTE2 instance folder
4. Remove the `DefaultQuests.json` file from the `config/betterquesting` folder
5. Download the `DefaultQuests_lang.json` file to the `config/betterquesting` folder and rename it to `DefaultQuests.json`
6. Run the instance and enjoy the game!

## TODO

- Currently, the only way to translate the file is in English. If we want to increase the number of languages, we need to change the file names.
